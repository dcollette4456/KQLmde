// I was trying to get this to detect bluetooth connections. It didn't work very well.

// This query retrieves network information for devices with specific network adapter types and device names.
// It's likely used to identify and gather details about a particular set of machines within the environment.

    // Filters the results to include only devices where the NetworkAdapterType contains the string "53".
    // This likely identifies a specific type of network interface (e.g., Ethernet).  The exact meaning of "53" would depend on the specific environment.
